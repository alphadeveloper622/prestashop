We are looking to create a new website in Spanish from 0 with Prestashop 1.7 for our promotional products company,

Among the most important requirements are the following points:

* Import 3 catalogs in CSV, linked to the stock in real time

* Redesign the product page to make it pleasant and simple to use
* Develop a printing cost calculator (5 different techniques)
* Show the minimum price (prices from) without printing. Example (https://bananaprint.es/c/cam camisetas-publicitarias)
* All products have a scaling of discounts by quantity

* Install a google merchancenter module and show the minimum price for each product
* Install modules for the following functions (Categorize products, Seo in products)

* On the product page, you can download the budget in PDF. Example (www.giftcampaign.es)

* One-step shopping cart (important to detail the printing costs added above)

* Include a button to download the technical sheet of the product in PDF,
Example https://www.falk-ross.eu/es/Products/T-shirts/T-shirt-E150.html

* include a button to view the image in 360,
Example: https://makito.es/epages/Makito.sf/sec0b207083c8/?ObjectPath=/Shops/Makito/Products/6569/SubProducts/6569%230100004400000000

* include video in the products that are available:
Example: https://www.falk-ross.eu/es/Brands/Gamegear-/Cam Camiseta-Cooltex-Gamegear-mujer.html?shp=1&lang=3&listtype=search&searchparam=00211&redirected=1

* Include the brand logo above the cover image on the catalog page
Example: https: //printman.com/comprar-shirts-manga-corta/

* Link invoices with the holded billing program
* Delivery period of the finished store (very important and decisive)

We have more information about the catalogs in CSV (Google Drive) and about the functionality of the calculator (explanatory document PDF)

We only want the development to be in prestashop 1.7.6, we are not open to using other systems such as Magento or WooCommerce

For this project the WAREHOUSE demo 9 template from themeforest = https://iqit-commerce.com/ps17/demo9/en/ will be used
