User Avatar
Do you want more information about our project? Do you have any doubt?
your requirements are clear
User Avatar
have you worked on a dynamic product in prestashop?
https://zaradiet.es
this is my previous live site
the owner of this site is also Spanish
the product page does not have any development
it is simple
1 single price
User Avatar
no combinations
and i built that site with prestashop
after login, you can see more details
if you need i can build a better site than that site
User Avatar
This site has a great job behind it
I see
I will satisfy all your requirements
i have rich prestashop experience
User Avatar
what would be your delivery time?
I have made theme and module of prestashop
how about 20 days
I will build your site in this month
User Avatar
Do you note that this requires a lot of programming?
yes
i want to build your site asap
I'm afraid that I can't get the truth. I have seen that I work on several projects but they are all more basic
User Avatar
this requires quite complex programming
I like hard programming
https://www.discountmugs.com/category/custom-t-shirts/
go to the first article
and I explain step by step
User Avatar
calculator functionality
yes
I am looking for that site
If you enter the article, you see that there are tabs that have different prices
by quantities and also by type of stamping
User Avatar
each tab calculates differently and opens different steps to follow
I see
User Avatar
That part, I consider to be complex
I also think the same
but i will solve it
User Avatar
what would be your doubts?
Should I clone that site?
User Avatar
that would not be possible, that site is custom developed and custom programmed .. I don't think it can be cloned without entering the database
I see
User Avatar
You also have to be able to see well on mobile phones, here in Europe people use mobile especially, the computer cannot be
yes
but i will try to clone for you
I am a receptive designer
I can do both backend and frontend

User Avatar
the one recommended by the person in charge of programming the web

I have many proposals for this project, other freelancer teach me other similar jobs
User Avatar
Would you have a job in prestashop with a custom programming?
yes
can i customize prestashop
can i make the prestashop module
that was clear to me,
User Avatar
but you have any previous work that you can check this
yes
User Avatar
yes
User Avatar
On the page he showed me, I don't see any programming, it is a product with a single price
smile emoji
I like hard programming
I understand, but if I don't see any previous work
User Avatar
it is difficult to accept your proposal
http://www.clhardware.com
How about this site?
You can tell me what would be the similarity with my project and what would be the programming that this website has

that are useful
User Avatar
from other websites

I'll do my best
you think you can do it
User Avatar
there are many requirements
I see
What is it ?
the csv are quite complex too
User Avatar

everybody
The one from Falkross, have you seen that it goes for tabs?
User Avatar
Can you include all the information?
yes
FalkRoss-ArticleMasterData_43012728

you may have to adapt it to the prestashop importer
User Avatar
do you use any module for this?
I see
I must do the module
those modules already exist
User Avatar
there are power modules
I know
I will check the possible modules
Orders export v4.6.5 - by MyPrestaModules
User Avatar
------
Product Catalog (CSV, Excel) Import v5.3.6 - by MyPrestaModules
yes
but I must verify that the module can import its csv correctly
the one with falkross
User Avatar
that module can be imported by parts
I see
What is Roly?
User Avatar
a mark in the google drive there is a notepad with the links of the providers
yes

Should i get products from 3 sites?
Among the most important requirements are the following points:

* Import 3 catalogs in CSV, linked to the stock in real time
User Avatar
I don't know if you have been able to review my project
How can you get csv?
User Avatar
know what a CSV is
Falk Ross is clear
but others is not clear
User Avatar
you know what a CSV file is. Can you explain it to me
that's the product list
right ?
in the google drive link is all the information
User Avatar
what would be what is not clear
Did you check csv on Roly?
they are not clear
they are very complex
it is not complex
it is separated by commas
User Avatar
it is one of the simplest
I see
Why doesn't Makito have anything?
just a docx
User Avatar
